# Cursor Rules

## Terminal Environment Fix

### PAGER Configuration
When using terminal commands in Cursor, the default PAGER setting can cause issues with AWS CLI and other commands that use pagers. Always set PAGER to a simple command to avoid parsing errors.

**Required Environment Setup:**
```bash
export PAGER=cat
```

**Problem:** 
Cursor's default `PAGER=head -n 10000 | cat` setting causes commands to fail with errors like:
```
head: |: No such file or directory
head: cat: No such file or directory
```

**Solution:**
Before running any AWS CLI commands or other commands that might use a pager, always execute:
```bash
export PAGER=cat
```

**Auto-fix Rule:**
If you encounter pager-related errors in terminal commands, immediately run `export PAGER=cat` before retrying the command.

**Affected Commands:**
- AWS CLI commands (aws logs, aws dynamodb, etc.)
- Git commands with output
- Any command that might use a pager

**Best Practice:**
Include `export PAGER=cat` at the beginning of any terminal session or script that will run multiple commands.
